"""
Logic operations for combining objects that represent named statements, to improve readability.

Named statements are represented as name/statement pairs in a dict.
Because conjunction is more common, it is represented my merging dicts.
Disjunction is represented by a list instead.

E.x.:
>>> a = Name(a, "A")
{"A": a}
>>> b = Name(b, "B")
{"B": b}
>>> And(a,b)
{"A": a, "B": b}
>>> Or(a,b)
[{"A":a}, {"B":b}]
